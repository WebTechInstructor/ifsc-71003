            1. - New Question - Software development often involves changing, fixing, and improving existing code. Recall your AI-generated sandbox. Manually (by hand, not using an AI) make three updates to the HTML in your sandbox code. Provide a link to the updated sandbox and explain the three changes. (This question is not expected to be terribly hard.)

          </ol>
        </div>

        <p>
          <strong>A. Explain the button HTML command, except for the JavaScript code part.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          The <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element is a flexible, interactive control that users can click to trigger actions—such as submitting a form or running JavaScript—depending on its defined <code>type</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>B. Explain the meaning of onclick, which is an argument to the
            button command.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>onclick</code> is an event handler attribute that executes JavaScript code when a user clicks on the element.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>C. Explain the JavaScript code assigned to the onclick argument.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The JS assigned to the onclick event handler looks for an element with the id of demo and then sets the html content of that element to the current date/time using a built in date function.
        </p>
        <p><strong>D. What does "demo" refer to?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          "demo" refers to the ID of a paragraph. The script looks for that ID and then injects html when a usern clicks on the button.
        </p>
        <strong>E. What does the function getElementById() do?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>getElementById()</code> is a DOM method that retrieves a single HTML element from the document based on its unique <code>id</code> attribute, allowing JavaScript to access and manipulate that specific element.
        </p>

        <strong>F. What does innerHTML refer to?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>innerHTML</code> is a DOM property that gets or sets the HTML content inside an element, allowing JavaScript to read, replace, or insert markup within that element.
        </p>
        <strong>G. What does the function Date() do?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>Date()</code> function in JavaScript is used to create a date object representing a specific moment in time, allowing developers to retrieve or manipulate the current date and time or a defined date value.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          2. Consider the "JavaScript Where To" lesson, linked from "JS Where To." JavaScript may be placed within HTML tags. Let us call these code passages "scripts." Can a script be placed in an HTML head, body, neither, or both?
        </p>

        <p>
          A script can be placed in either the HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> or the
          <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section. It may be written inline within the page
          or linked externally using the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. While scripts
          can appear in both sections, larger external scripts are often placed just
          before the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag to improve page loading performance.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          4a. Consider external JavaScript code. Why might code be placed in an external file file instead of in a web page?
        </p>
        <p>
          By externalizing our scripts we can include and reuse them in multiple pages without having to maintain multiple versions of a script.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          4b. Consider external JavaScript code. Find the external code file myScript.js on the W3schools site. What is the URL of that file?
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript.js</code>
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          5a. Alphabetize all of the HTML commands. This way it will be easier to find any command in the list. Also number them.
        </p>
        <p>For this answer I went ahead and stuck with the organizational structure I chose at the begining of the semester rather than reflow thee entire document alphabetically. I feel the code previews for each section and the overall layout still meets the desired goal of being a useful reesource. Elements are grouped by type and there is a global element count and a per section element count in the top right corner of each element. </p>

        <p class="question">
          5b. At the end of your HTML test page, put 4 new buttons on it. One button demonstrates output to the innerHTML location of an HTML element. Another button demonstrates (when you click it) the document.write() output method. A third button demonstrates output using the alert() function. And a final button calls window.print(). Clearly indicate what each button is for, or you might not get credit for it.

        <p class="question">
          5c. Consider output using console.log(). Explain what you see in the console, or provide a screen shot of the console containing a logged output.
        </p>
        <p>
        <p>
          When using <code>console.log()</code>, the output appears in the browser’s
          Developer Tools console rather than on the web page itself. The logged message
          is displayed as plain text or structured data and is primarily used for debugging
          and inspecting code behavior during development.
        </p>

        <pre><code>
// Example of writing to the console
console.log("Hello, this is a message in the console.");

let number = 42;
console.log("The value of number is:", number);
</code></pre>
        </p>

        <script>
          console.log("Hello, this is a message in the console.");
          let number = 42;
          console.log("The value of number is:", number);
        </script>

          6a. Process mapping. Process Mapping Assignment: Modern Pentathlon Website Concept 
        </p>
<h3>a) Website Concept: <span>PentathlonPulse</span></h3>

    <h4>What is distinctive about the site</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>PentathlonPulse</strong> focuses on what makes modern pentathlon unique:
      <em>combined scoring</em> and how performance in one event changes what an athlete needs in the next.
      The site is designed to help fans understand ranking changes and strategic implications as the competition unfolds.
    </p>

    <h5>Signature Feature: “What Do I Need Now?” Tracker</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Users select an athlete (or create a watch list).</li>
      <li>The site shows current points, rank, and the performance needed in the next event to move up.</li>
      <li>During the laser-run, it visualizes start gaps and live position changes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Second Feature: Rules Explainer Layer</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Users can click “Why did my rank change?” on any event page.</li>
      <li>The site provides a simple explanation tied directly to scoring rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How the site works</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Visitors can browse athlete profiles, event explanations, and meet results without logging in.</li>
      <li>Logged-in users can follow athletes/competitions, set notifications, save scenarios, and comment.</li>
      <li>The site imports official results (or allows admin uploads), stores data, and calculates points/ranks using rules references.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>AI Attribution and Methodology Statement</h3>
  <p>
    This assignment was completed with assistance from ChatGPT (OpenAI). The AI was used to help
    structure the website concept and organize the Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) according to systems
    analysis principles.
  </p>
  <p>
    The interaction was iterative: I developed the core concept first, then used AI to help identify
    external entities, processes, data stores, and data flows for the Level 0, Level 1, and Level 2
    diagrams. All diagrams were reviewed and adjusted by me to ensure they follow proper DFD
    conventions and meet the assignment requirements.
  </p>

  <p>Both charts were made by hand in Lucid chart by creating .drawio files, importing to lucid chart and then tweaking for readability. It was tedious, but I wamnted to experimeent with chart making workflows.</p>
