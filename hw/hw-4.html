            1. Add to the form in your growing demo page of HTML commands,
            commands, commands, commands. Make sure it is linked from your HW4
            as the answer to this question/question/ so we do not have to hunt
            for it. It is becoming a kind of dictionary of HTML commands,

          <p class="question">
            3 & 4 - For some system at UALR (registration, or choose another
            one), or for the process of getting to UALR (involving travel
            authorizations and so on), analyze it using FMEA. You can
            investigate just one failure mode. For this question, identify which
            possible causes are reasonable and which can be excluded. Using
            this, give suggestions about potential improvements. <br><br>
            <small>NOTE: I had completed this question in the form it was in last year.
              The question changed after I completed the assignment</small>
          </p>
          <p>
            In the course registration process within Workday, I focused on one
            failure mode: a prerequisite not being recognized. Reasonable causes
            included missing transcript data or system sync issues, while
            unlikely causes, like the student not existing in the system, were
            excluded. Based on that, I’d suggest improvements such as automated
            transcript validation, smoother data syncing, and clearer real-time
            notifications during registration.

          <p class="question">
            5. Apply the 5 Whys technique to the same system that you just
            addressed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the 5 Whys on the same issue—prerequisite not recognized—I
            started with the problem: the system didn’t recognize the
            prerequisite. Why? The transcript wasn’t in the system. Why? It
            hadn’t been digitized. Why? A staffing freeze delayed that step.
            Why? The process relied entirely on manual entry. Why? Leadership
            hadn’t planned for automation or backup. The root cause was that
            manual processes had no fallback. This points directly to a need for
            automation or contingency plans.

              Mode Effects and Analysis (FMEA) on this problem, and briefly

              suitable for each technique.</del

            <del
              >FMEA helped prioritize potential failure modes by severity,
              occurrence, and detection. It’s great when multiple risks need
              ranking—like in complex systems with many possible issues. On the
              other hand, 5 Whys drilled down to one root cause. It’s more
              useful when one dominant problem needs solving. FMEA suits
              technical or safety-critical processes, while 5 Whys fits process
              breakdowns or recurring issues. Sometimes, both can complement
              each other, offering breadth and depth and alternate lens to
              evaluate the problem.</del

            <strong>Note:</strong>The responses in this analysis were formulated
            through an iterative dialogue with an AI language model (GPT). The
            model posed probing questions and helped refine each step, ensuring
            clarity in both the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and the
            5 Whys application, ultimately guiding the comparison of both
            techniques."
