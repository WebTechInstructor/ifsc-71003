            Strengths One of the strongest aspects of this assignment is that it
            pushes students beyond surface-level feature comparison and into
            conceptual thinking about what forums are and why they exist. By
            requiring analysis across multiple systems rather than focusing on a
            single example, the assignment encourages students to identify
            underlying patterns related to community design, moderation, and
            user experience. This makes the learning transferable rather than
            tool-specific. The use of Socratic questioning is another major
            strength. Instead of passively consuming information, students are
            required to articulate their own reasoning and refine it over
            multiple iterations. This mirrors real-world analytical thinking
            more closely than traditional short-answer or multiple-choice
            formats and helps students build confidence in their
            interpretations. Finally, the inclusion of both technical platforms
            (phpBB, Discourse) and a real-world community (Ars Technica forums)
            adds depth. It helps students understand that forum design is not
            just about software, but also about culture, governance, and
            long-term community investment.
          </p>

          <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
          <p>
            From a learning standpoint, the assignment could benefit from
            clearer expectations about deliverables. While the exploratory
            nature is valuable, students may be unsure how much depth is
            required or how their responses will ultimately be assessed.
            Providing a brief rubric or example of a “strong response” would
            help students calibrate their effort without reducing the open-ended
            nature of the task. Additionally, the assignment assumes a certain
            level of prior familiarity with forums. Students who have primarily
            experienced social media or chat-based platforms may struggle to
            contextualize older systems like phpBB without additional
            scaffolding. A short historical overview or framing paragraph could
            help level the playing field.
          </p>

          <p class="question">
            4. Consider taking this course or another course you are currently
            enrolled in, and wanting to get as much out of it as possible. The
            problem statement, then, is something like "I want to get as much as
            possible out of taking the course (fill in course number here)." Or
            perhaps, "Suppose a student wants to get as much as possible out of
            taking the course (fill in course number here)." Analyze it using a
            detailed fishbone diagram. Really get into the diagram with lots of
            detail and branches. Every aspect can be considered, from travel to
            study habits to life schedules to everything else. Include at least
            a few sub-sub-branches. You can draw it by hand and take a phone cam
            shot of it. Or, use a tool or template from the web (however, one
            problem doing it this way is that most of the free resources don't
            support sub-sub-branches.

          <h3>Fishbone Analysis: IFSC 11003 Student Value</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Problem Statement:</strong> This analysis examines the
            factors that influence whether a student gains the highest practical
            value—skills, portfolio development, and confidence—from IFSC 11003.
            A fishbone (cause-and-effect) diagram was used to identify and
            organize the primary contributing factors.

              <h3 id="cat-1">1. Student Background &amp; Mindset</h3>
              <p>
                Student mindset strongly affects outcomes in IFSC 11003.
                <strong>Self-initiated learners</strong> tend to engage more
                deeply, practice independently, and recover more quickly from
                setbacks. Students who are
                <strong>willing to experiment and break things</strong> develop
                resilience and improve debugging skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                A
                <strong>desire to create visually polished work</strong>
                increases motivation, especially during CSS and the final
                project, while
                <strong>intellectual curiosity</strong> encourages exploration
                beyond required examples. These traits support persistence and
                deeper understanding.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section aria-labelledby="cat-2">
              <h3 id="cat-2">2. Time, Schedule, &amp; Life Constraints</h3>
              <p>
                Many students balance coursework with jobs and family
                responsibilities. <strong>Busy schedules</strong> reduce
                available practice time. Students who
                <strong>do not participate in real time</strong> often struggle
                more than those who attend live sessions because they miss
                immediate feedback and live problem-solving.
              </p>
              <p>
                Technology access matters as well. A
                <strong>lack of a reliable laptop</strong>, unstable internet,
                or limited screen space increases friction and frustration,
                particularly for remote participants.

            <section aria-labelledby="cat-3">
              <h3 id="cat-3">3. Technical Setup &amp; Tools</h3>
              <p>
                Cloud-based development environments reduce setup barriers, but
                students still struggle with
                <strong>file management and naming conventions</strong>. Poor
                organization frequently creates errors that are difficult for
                beginners to diagnose.
              </p>
              <p>
                Students often resist or misunderstand
                <strong>version control</strong>, initially viewing GitHub as
                unnecessary or intimidating. This is compounded by
                <strong>terminal anxiety</strong> and the cognitive load of
                working across multiple tools.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section aria-labelledby="cat-4">
              <h3 id="cat-4">4. Course Structure &amp; Instruction</h3>
              <p>
                The course is intentionally <strong>cumulative</strong>, making
                early assignments foundational for later work. When students
                skip or delay early tasks, gaps compound quickly. The
                <strong>fast-paced</strong>
                design further limits recovery time, and relying on recordings
                can create a false sense of progress.
              </p>
              <p>
                Assessments are <strong>skill-based and low-stakes</strong>,
                encouraging experimentation, but they rely on consistent
                participation. <strong>Feedback limitations</strong> due to
                large enrollment can also allow misunderstandings to persist
                longer than ideal.

              <h3 id="cat-5">5. Study Habits &amp; Practice Behaviors</h3>
              <p>
                Students who <strong>live-code during class</strong> and
                <strong>debug outside of class</strong> consistently show
                stronger skill development. Debugging reinforces
                cause-and-effect understanding in code.
              </p>
              <p>
                Students who
                <strong>experiment beyond provided examples</strong> and
                maintain <strong>consistent weekly practice</strong> retain
                skills more effectively and adapt more easily as complexity
                increases.

              <p>
                <strong>Weekly labs</strong> provide structured practice and
                early intervention opportunities.
                <strong>Video and written tutorials</strong> support different
                learning styles and allow students to review material at their
                own pace.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Real-time Q&amp;A</strong> and instructor
                <strong>willingness to re-explain concepts</strong> reduce
                intimidation and encourage persistence, supporting student
                confidence and retention.

            <h2 id="ai-methodology">AI Methodology Statement</h2>
            <p>
              This assignment was completed using a human–AI collaborative
              process. I provided the full assignment prompt and course-specific
              context, and the AI guided me through building the fishbone
              analysis step by step by asking structured questions and helping
              me organize my responses into categories and branches.
            </p>
            <p>
              The AI was used to refine wording for clarity and to convert my
              content into diagram-ready formats (outline, ASCII, and HTML). All
              course details, judgments (including which causes were reasonable
              or excludable), and final suggestions came from me. The AI’s role
              was organizational and editorial, not a replacement for my
              analysis.
            </p>
            <h2>Tooling</h2>
            <p>
              The chart was created using the free version of
              <a href="https://lucid.app/">Lucid Chart</a>. I found the tool to
              be straightforward and relatively easy to use. I do think these
              types of char​t become difficult as the complexity grows. I think
              adding another tier of information would have overwhelmed the
              user. Also as you stated Lucid chart freee tier did not support
              the number of shapes I needed to comple the diagram. I also
              experimented with Miro and their AI prompting engine but I don't
              think AI is quite there yet when it comes to making ​d​iagrams
              with the look and feel that I desired.

              <p>
                <strong>AI:</strong> At the most basic level, what kind of
                problem is a fishbone diagram best suited for, and what kind of
                problem is it not well suited for?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Student:</strong> Fishbone diagrams are well suited for
                root cause analysis and are an excellent mechanism for
                brainstorming potential problems. They are useful for
                identifying contributing factors rather than directly producing
                concrete solutions.

                <strong>Student:</strong> The process of identifying dimensions

                <strong>AI:</strong> What criteria would you use to decide when
                it is worth creating custom categories?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Student:</strong> Meaningful customization requires
                domain expertise within the group so that categories can be
                created thoughtfully and accurately.

                <strong>AI:</strong> What risks arise if a team without
                sufficient domain expertise builds a fishbone diagram anyway?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Student:</strong> The value lies in the discovery
                process itself. If the diagram is used constructively to broaden
                perspective rather than to produce definitive conclusions, it
                can still be useful even without deep expertise.

              <p>
                <strong>AI:</strong> How would you explain the purpose of a
                fishbone diagram so teams do not mistake it for proof of root
                cause?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Student:</strong> I would explain that the process of
                building the diagram is an opportunity for different
                perspectives to examine the same problem. The outcome may not be
                prescriptive, but it can be informative and helpful in
                identifying next steps.

              <p>
                <strong>Student:</strong> It fits best early in the
                problem-solving process. It helps build team consensus, ensures
                all voices are heard, and allows leadership to identify
                different perspectives early when guiding mitigation steps.

  <p><strong>B) Process Reflection</strong></p>

  <p>
    Using an AI to provide Socratic questioning on fishbone diagrams was more effective
    than I initially expected. Instead of receiving a static explanation of what a
    fishbone diagram is, the question-and-answer format forced me to articulate
    <em>why</em> the technique works, <em>when</em> it is useful, and <em>where</em> it fits
    in a broader problem-solving process. The pacing of one question at a time was
    especially helpful, as it prevented me from jumping ahead to conclusions and
    instead encouraged incremental refinement of my thinking.
  </p>

  <p>
    What stood out most was how the Socratic approach surfaced assumptions I didn’t
    initially realize I was making, particularly around the role of domain expertise
    and the risk of treating the diagram as a definitive diagnosis rather than a
    discovery tool. Being prompted to explain limitations as well as strengths helped
    deepen my understanding of fishbone diagrams as a <strong>process</strong> rather than
    an artifact. The experience felt closer to a guided discussion than to traditional
    AI-generated content, which made the learning more active and reflective.
  </p>

  <p>
    In terms of prompting strategy, explicitly requesting <strong>Socratic questioning
    with one question at a time</strong> was critical and is something I would not change.
    That instruction clearly shaped the interaction and kept the AI from reverting to
    lecture-style explanations. If I were to adjust anything in the future, I might
    specify the desired <em>length</em> or <em>complexity</em> of each question depending on the
    depth of analysis I want, or ask for occasional reflective pauses to synthesize
    learning mid-exercise rather than only at the end.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, this approach was effective in stretching my thinking and helped me engage
    more deeply with the topic than a conventional explanation would have. It reinforced
    that how you prompt an AI matters as much as what you ask it to explain.
