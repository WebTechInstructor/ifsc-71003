          <p class="question">
1. Why is the minimum score on an assignment in this course 50%? In your HW1 file, give your opinion or conclusion, and also explain why.
          </p>
          <p>
            A 50-point floor makes a lot of sense from an inclusive pedagogy standpoint. It removes the sense of mathematical hopelessness where one missed deadline effectively ends the semester, which disproportionately impacts students dealing with ADHD, family issues, or other real-life disruptions. It prevents a single zero from functioning like a negative grade and keeps the possibility of passing visible, so students don’t disengage the moment things go sideways.</p><p>The tension is that in a technical, skills-based field like front-end development, a 50% floor can become a false floor. It can obscure the difference between a student who made a recoverable mistake and one who genuinely cannot produce working code. That’s the balance to manage: offering a path back from failure without inflating outcomes or implying competence that is not actually demonstrated in the work.</p>
