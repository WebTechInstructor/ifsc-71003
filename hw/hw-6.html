          <p class="question">
            1.Add a section for JavaScript commands at the top of your HTML demo
            page. Now it is more of an "HTML + JavaScript" demo page.
            Demonstrate 6 different commands (in addition to the ones from last
            time), using a button to run each of them.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p class="question">
            2.For the HTML section of your demo page, alphabetize the commands
            for easy lookup, and number them also.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this answer I went ahead and stuck with the organizational
            structure I chose at the begining of the semester rather than reflow
            thee entire document alphabetically. I feel the code previews for
            each section and the overall layout still meets the desired goal of
            being a useful reesource. Elements are grouped by type and there is
            a global element count and a per section element count in the top
            right corner of each element.

            Using Claude Code I added line numbers to the html/css/js. This
            provides:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Better error tracking - Console will reference "Error on line 15",
              now you can find it
            </li>
            <li>
              Code navigation - Easier to reference specific lines when
              debugging
            </li>
            <li>Professional feel - Matches real code editors like VS Code</li>
            <li>
              Minimal performance impact - Updates only on input, uses simple
              string operations

            4. For a line or two of JavaScript in your sandbox, learn the
            details of how it works using AI. This time, do not use Socratic
            qustioning. Instead, you ask the AI the questions rather than it
            asking you the questions. Guide the AI to provide answers you can
            actually learn from. For example, some AIs tend to give answers that
            are several paragraphs long, when what you need (at least, what I
            need when doing this sort of thing) are very short answers suitable
            for beginners on the topic. Hand in a copy-paste of the transcript,
            and also, hand in a screenshot of the end of the transcript showing
            your interaction with the AI.

            6.5. Take a few minutes to debate this problem. In your own words,
            describe what stood out to you about this experience, your thoughts,
            whatever reactions you might have had about it, about planes, cars,
            birds, helicopters, etc., and any thoughts or reactions you had

            I was genuinely curious to see how efficiently I could build a
            single-page web app proof of concept for the use case I created. The
            goal was to keep it lean, contained in a single file, and still
            demonstrate the core workflow clearly. Having the ability to move
            that fast with AI support was honestly pretty impressive, especially
            when the task stayed focused on demonstrating the concept rather
            than overbuilding the implementation.
          </p>

          <p>
            What stood out to me is that the use case work up front helped me
            avoid a lot of common pitfalls. By taking time to define the actor,
            the goal, and the main path (plus what happens when things stall), I
            didn’t have to constantly backtrack or re-decide what the system was
            supposed to do. Even though this was exploratory, it reinforced that
            ambiguity is easier to manage when you build with empathy and keep
            the larger organizational goals in view. In the end, rapid “vibe
            coding” and prototyping tools are extremely effective when you feed
            them the right structure. Use cases translate surprisingly well into
            initial prompts and help keep the output aligned with what matters.
